AI still can not work alone

Writing the correct prompt is not trivial
Having this skill will give you job safety in the coming years
Prompt engineering will probably be a significant player in most professions

Do GPTs understand things? Yes. The magic of the tech is that GPTs basically have to accidentally learn concepts in a deep way so they can properly predict the next letter in a sequence. It can then apply those concepts in new situations.

But does a GPT know what it feels like to love? Or to contemplate the universe? Or human mortality? No. They haven’t a clue. They don’t have feelings. They’re not conscious. They don’t experience things one little bit.

What are the building blocks of AI?
- Model: Mathematical representations of a system, the brain behind them
- Prompt: A "request" to the model
- Token: "Bits" on the wire, atoms of the AI universe 
- Completions: The response from the model

- fine-tuning the model is dumbing it down
